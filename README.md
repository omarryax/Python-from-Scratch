# 🐍 Python from Scratch

Welcome to my Python Revision Repository!

## 📚 About

This repository is dedicated to revising Python programming concepts **from scratch** as part of my university course. I’m revisiting and practicing topics using lecture slides and resources provided during my academic journey.

Whether you're a beginner starting out or someone revising the basics, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## 🎯 Goals

- Refresh core Python concepts
- Practice hands-on coding from university slides
- Build a strong Python foundation for advanced courses like Data Science, AI/ML, and Software Development

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Libraries Overview
- Data Types & Variables
- Type Conversion
- Operators
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
- File I/O
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (Coming Soon...)

## 🏫 Academic Context

This revision is based on the Python material taught in my university course at **Air University Islamabad**, BSAI program. It's a personal initiative to retain and sharpen my coding fundamentals.

## 💻 How to Use

- Clone or download the repo
- Explore the folders/topics by chapter
- Run the Python files using any IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook)

## 📌 Note

This is a revision project — some files may be raw notes, partially complete, or for experimentation only.
